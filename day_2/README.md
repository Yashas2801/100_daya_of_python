# Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator is a Python program that helps calculate the total bill, including a tip percentage, and splits the amount among a specified number of people. It is a practical tool for making bill-splitting easier and faster in real-life scenarios.

## Day 2: Concepts Learned

On the second day of my Python learning journey, I explored several foundational programming concepts:

1. **Python Primitive Data Types**:
   - Learned about basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `str`.

2. **Typecasting and Type Checking**:
   - Used functions like `float()` and `int()` to convert user input into numerical data.
   - Understood how to check data types using the `type()` function.

3. **Mathematical Operators**:
   - Practiced using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` to perform calculations.

4. **String Manipulation with f-strings**:
   - Applied formatted string literals (`f-strings`) to include variables dynamically within strings.

5. **Basic Program Flow**:
   - Built a complete program by combining inputs, processing logic, and outputs in a sequential manner.

## How the Program Works

1. The user is asked to input:
   - The total bill amount.
   - The percentage of the tip they'd like to give (e.g., 10%, 12%, or 15%).
   - The number of people splitting the bill.

2. The program calculates:
   - The total amount (bill + tip).
   - The share each person needs to pay.

3. Finally, it displays the results in a user-friendly format.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $100
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 15
How many people to split the bill? 4
bill + tip : 115.0
Each person should pay: 28.75
