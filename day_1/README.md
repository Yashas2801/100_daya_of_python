# Brand Name Generator

This is a simple Python program that generates a creative brand name by combining a city name and a pet's name. It was created as part of my daily Python learning journey.

## Day 1: Concepts Learned

On the first day of my Python journey, I focused on the following concepts:

1. **Printing to the Console**:
   - Used the `print()` function to display messages and outputs.

2. **String Manipulation**:
   - Combined strings using the `+` operator to form the final brand name.

3. **Code Instruments and Debugging**:
   - Practiced writing, testing, and debugging Python code.

4. **Python Input Function**:
   - Used the `input()` function to collect user inputs dynamically.

5. **Variables and Variable Naming**:
   - Learned how to declare variables and name them appropriately to store data.
